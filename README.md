Our contribution to the 2nd CASSINI Hackathon on "Connection the Arctic". 

A **polar navigation platform** that provides **safe routing over ice** for land vehicles in **arctic regions** influenced by **climate change**.


Our POC use case, of finding the optimal path between 2 locations in Northern Canada over the icey sea in January.
